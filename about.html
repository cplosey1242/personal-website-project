Currently, he is taking a semester to study at LCC International University in Klaipeda, Lithuania where he is studying International Business. Carter aspires to work overseas for a major corporation as a Sales Representative upon graduating from Taylor University.  </p> 
			<p>Some things Carter enjoys doing is include hiking, traveling, taking photos, exploring new places, reading, and spending time with friends and family. Carter discovered a passion for photography while on a business trip to Kabale, Uganda. Here Carter worked as a consultant to help non-profit organizations develop detailed business plans. While in Uganda, Carter and his travel mate were also tasked with shooting film and taking pictures to show as marketing material in the United States. It was here that Carter was able to learn how to use a camera. Carter's favorite thing to photograph is nature, as he enjoys exploring God's creation everyday. </p>
